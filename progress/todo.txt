you could create an expand_struct function, that would take

Check back-end to see if can be improved

** Utility Functions

bundle.m ("bundles" its arguments into a struct) - DONE

rows.m
cols.m

** Bug fixes

Makes sure extra mats are selected properlya

propval.m can take a long time: if a nested function is being applied
      20000 times, this is not good at all.  FIX!

pdist already uses mex files; it's slow purely becuase of the parameter
    checks at the beginning.

the mask should probably be stored as a bunch of 0's...?
