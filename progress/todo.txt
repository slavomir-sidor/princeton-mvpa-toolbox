Subj maintenance and accessor scripts
-
*** high-priority
need a way of creating a volume from a pattern. we'll need this if we
want to write 4D patterns-with-time back to AFNI, for instance

*** high-priority
better documentation for optional arguments, custom functions etc.

*** low-priority
propval's a mess. it should take an optional cellORstruct arg, that
defaults to cell. that way it can do proper error-checking with decent
expectations

*** low-priority
add a check so that set_object doesn''t allow you to set the mat

*** low-priority
add a flag so that load_afni_mask can deal with sub-briks

*** low-priority
when you remove an object, it should rename it '_removed', which
get_number will know to check for
refuse to init an object called '_...'

*** high-priority
fix duplicate_object (and any calls to it) so that group_name is a
standard optional parameter

- Our philosophy regarding the removal of TRs, and how it differs
from the philosophy of removing voxels
- Accessing subj structure directly
- classification and results
- see conversation with ken about other docs stuff
- FAQ
- Importing a pattern of arbitrary size without a mask
- Divide by zero from backprop
- Mention when you need the stats toolbox
     mention that prestd might do the same thing as zscore
- Good practices
		   save out as many of the patterns to the hd as
		   possible beforehand
		   lower case
		   split up your BRIKs
- Info about subj.x
- Definitions
	e.g. selectors are discrete, probably exclusive and 1xtimepoints
	stick with the selectors name
- Censoring TRs and dealing with rest
- Conventions
    commenting of m-files
    book-keeping objects, e.g. creation - checklist for developers
    propval argumentations
    incorporate conventions.txt
- Using scripts without using the whole toolbox infrastructure
- More on getting started and setting up work environment
- Running this on your own data
- Things to avoid when designing an experiment
    e.g. diff sizes of conditions, diff sized runs, one condition per run
- How to do event-related
- Solicit requests for future directions
- Extract memory documentation from init_object

*** low-priority
need sample dataset stuff

*** high-priority
Things to talk to Ben Singer about
- Setting up a bulletin board (internal and external)
- Other stuff discussed with CDM and MJB
- SVN permissions
- Adding SVN module for papers
- SVN encrypted passwords
- Adding SVN users
- Bugzilla
- M2HTML
- Wikipedia
