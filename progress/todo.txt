- Our philosophy regarding the removal of TRs, and how it differs
from the philosophy of removing voxels
- Accessing subj structure directly
- classification and results
- see conversation with ken about other docs stuff
- FAQ
- Importing a pattern of arbitrary size without a mask
- Divide by zero from backprop
- Mention when you need the stats toolbox
     mention that prestd might do the same thing as zscore
- Good practices
		   save out as many of the patterns to the hd as
		   possible beforehand
		   lower case
		   split up your BRIKs
- Info about subj.x

	e.g. selectors are discrete, probably exclusive and 1xtimepoints
	stick with the selectors name

- Conventions
    commenting of m-files
    book-keeping objects, e.g. creation - checklist for developers
    propval argumentations
    incorporate conventions.txt
- Using scripts without using the whole toolbox infrastructure
- More on getting started and setting up work environment
- Running this on your own data
- Things to avoid when designing an experiment
    e.g. diff sizes of conditions, diff sized runs, one condition per run
- How to do event-related
- Solicit requests for future directions
- Extract memory documentation from init_object

*** low-priority
need sample dataset stuff

*** high-priority
create instructions for internal testing
Things we want people to point out and try:

*** low-priority
update the 'removing conditions' section of the documentation

*** low-priority
