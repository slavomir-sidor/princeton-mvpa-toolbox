*** 0.6.1
Minor changes to tutorial_easy.htm to fix the new lowercase load_afni_pattern.m and load_afni_mask.m. Also fixed the call to cross_validation.m so that class_args is the last argument, and so that it uses train_ and test_funct_name in the class_args - thanks to Ronnie Bryan
Fixed teeny bug in set_objsubfield.m so that ignore_empty -> args.ignore_empty
Ran mlint to fix any bugs with sprintf, variables that don't get used etc. Also changed all the 'exist' calls to use two arguments, all the and and or to be short-circuit versions (i.e. && and ||)
Added Chris Moore's 'Dude, where's my voxel?' section to the manual
Added Ehren Newman's trainscg suggestions
