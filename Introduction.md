# Stated Goals #
The aim of the MVPA toolbox effort is to create a set of open-source functions in a widely used language to facilitate exploration of multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques and to reduce the 'startup costs' for knowledgeable users eager to apply pattern classification algorithms to their imaging data. By developing the toolbox in the Matlab environment, users are able to take advantage of the vast array of existing functions. The data structures used and generated by the toolbox are designed to facilitate exploration and further script development.
