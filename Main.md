# Welcome to the Princeton MVPA Toolbox Wiki #

This wiki contains the latest documentation for the [Princeton MVPA Toolbox](http://code.google.com/p/princeton-mvpa-toolbox/). Please note the section header tabs at the top of the page.

If you're new to the toolbox, you will want to check out [Setup](Setup.md) for installation instructions, and then look through [Tutorials](Tutorials.md) to get started. The [Manual](Manual.md) provides more detailed coverage on the toolbox for technical users.

Looking for the [EBC documentation](ExpansionEBC.md)?

Update: Keith Bartley has recently written [OctaveMVPA](https://github.com/bartleyneuro/OctaveMVPA), a port to Octave (for those without Matlab licenses).
