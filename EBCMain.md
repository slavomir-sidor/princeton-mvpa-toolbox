# The Princeton EBC team #

Princeton submitted multiple entries to the [2006 Pittsburgh EBC fMRI analysis competition](http://pbc.lrdc.pitt.edu/). The competition's aim was to "challenge multiple groups to use state-of-the-art techniques to infer subjective experience from a rigorously collected set of fMRI".

Our entries were the result of collaboration among students, postdocs and faculty from multiple departments at Princeton, including Psychology, Physics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Applied Mathematics. Over the course of the competition, members of the EBC team met on a regular basis to discuss methods & share code. The team was comprised of the following researchers (in alphabetical order):  David Blei, Eugene Brevdo, Ronald Bryan, Melissa Carroll, Denis Chigirev, Greg Detre, Andrew Engell, Shannon Hughes, Christopher Moore, Ehren Newman, Ken Norman, Vaidehi Natu, Susan Robison, Greg Stephens, Matt Weber, and David Weiss. The team was coordinated by Greg Detre (a Psychology graduate student) and supervised by Ken Norman (a Psychology faculty member).

## Biographies ##

### Denis Chigirev ###
a physics graduate student at Princeton University.  After graduation from Physical Technical High School #566 in St. Petersburg, Russia, Denis won a top prize at International Physics Olympiad and was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago.  He then spent a year at Trinity College, Cambridge University, before joining Princeton as a graduate student.  There he became interested in problems at the intersection of physics, biology and computer science.  He is currently finishing his dissertation.

### Greg Stephens ###
received Ph.D. in Physics (Cosmology) from the University of Maryland.  He currently holds a joint postdoctoral position between the Physics Department and the Center for Brain, Mind and Behavior at Princeton University.  Denis and Greg are also active members of the Biophysics Theory group headed by Bill Bialek.

## OHBM information ##

Melissa Carroll, Denis Chigirev, Greg Detre, Andy Engell, Ehren Newman and Greg Stephens will be attending the 2006 [Human Brain Mapping Conference](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1) in Florence, where they will be presenting:

[The Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) toolbox - (50 W-PM)](http://princeton-mvpa-toolbox.googlecode.com/files/PosterOhbm06.html)

## The MVPA toolbox ##

Many members of the Princeton EBC team are also involved with the [MVPA toolbox](http://code.google.com/p/princeton-mvpa-toolbox) effort, which aims to create a Matlab-based toolbox to facilitate pattern classification and multivariate prediction analyses on fMRI neuroimaging data, supported by the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](http://www.princeton.edu/neuroscience/) (formerly the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior).

We have released a set of MVPA toolbox scripts tailored specifically to the EBC competition. See the [EBC Extension](ExpansionEBC.md) page for more information.
