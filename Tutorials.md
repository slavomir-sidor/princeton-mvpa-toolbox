## Tutorials ##
[Introductory](TutorialIntro.md) - Essential reading.  This will give you a basic introduction to the way MVPA works, and what you can do with it. Many of the other tutorials build on the SUBJ structure that this tutorial builds.

  * [SPM based Intro](TutorialIntroSPM.md) - The same tutorial as above except handling spm files instead of afni briks.

[Advanced](TutorialAdv.md) - A series of short guides showing in-depth how to do several common tasks. Definitely worth reading.

[Averaging](TutorialAvg.md) - A brief tutorial on how to average timepoints together.

[Using AFNI's GLM (3dDeconvolve) for voxel selection](TutorialAfniGlm.md). This talks you through n-1 feature selection using AFNI's general linear model, all being controlled by the MVPA toolbox from within Matlab.

[Classification-related tips and tricks](TutorialClass.md).

  * [Creating 'importance maps' based on classifier weights](TutorialImportanceMaps.md)

  * [Spherical searchlights](TutorialSpheres.md) for voxel selection and brain maps.

  * [Using AdaBoost for classification](TutorialBoosting.md)

[EBC tutorial](TutorialEBC.md) - For those who participated in the [EBC competition](http://www.ebc.pitt.edu) or want another dataset to work with.  This will guide you through using the [EBC Expansion](ExpansionEBC.md) to the MVPA Toolbox.

[Visualizing your data](TutorialVisualization.md) in various ways.

[Writing unit tests for MVPA functions](TutorialUnitTesting.md)
