You can download example data files from:

http://sun.csbmb.princeton.edu/downloads/distpat

for the benchmarks. The current files there are:

s2_all_lowres+orig.BRIK [384MB]
s2_all_lowres+orig.HEAD [128K]
subj_master_small.mat   [27MB]

These aren't being kept in the repository because of
their size (the HEAD is there since it goes with BRIK).
